The files here were useful in constructing the printed 1st Edition.

1. In Matlab, run publishAll.m from the main guide directory (add it to the path first). It will publish all the guide files twice, creating latex files in latex/color and latex/bw for color and B&W figures.

2. I manually converted the guide10_07.png file to eps, and edited the \includegraphics line in each copy of guide10.tex to give it a [width=6in] argument. This could be auomated...

3. Copy in the extra PDF files from this folder to each of the two versions.

4.  Run the processAll script in each of the two version directories.
