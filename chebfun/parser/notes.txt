    - Matlab -> MATLAB(R)
    - remez  -> *|<#CHEBDOC:remez remez>|*
    - mathematical expressions TeXified as, e.g., $\sin(x)$
    - some new terms (e.g. 'chebfun') bolded as *chebfun*
    - interchapter links introduced with <guide8.html Chapter 8>
      (there is no tag for them -- does there need to be?)


Keep in mind
----
    - There are several FIXMEs around the Guide.
    - Some chapters have hard links to, e.g., Chebfun examples.
      Just keep them in mind in case the site migrates.


Things that are broken in the Guide
----
    Chapter 1.
        - `blowup` flag
        - `unbndfun`
        - include details on `blowup` in `chebpref`
          (we refer the user to it)
        - include details on `minsamples` in `chebpref`
          (we refer the user to it)

    Chapter 2.
        - the narrow spike function does not integrate properly;
          either we need to use `minsamples` or fix what changed in `sum`;
          "the integral comes out correct to full precision" is a lie
        - `blowup` again
        - why is the Chebfun approximation to `erf` three digits less
          accurate than it was in V4? there must be a bug in `cumsum`:
          integral from soldner's contant to 2 of dx/log(x):
                exact:      1.045163780117492
                v4 guide:   1.045163780117491
                current v5: 1.045163779127723
        - should we show delta functions on chebfun plots?
        - "MATLAB `quad` will be removed in future release: use `integral` instead"
        - Bad doc 'The main CHEBFUN constructor!' (when linking to 'vectorize')
        - `jacpoly` not implemented

    Chapter 3.
        - `round`, `floor`, `ceil` not implemented
        - cannot distinguish local minima and maxima at points where diff(f)
          is discontinuous because deltafuns have not been implemented;
          compare, e.g., this in v4 and v5:
                h = abs(chebfun('x'));
                extrema = roots(diff(h));
                h2 = diff(h,2);
                minima = extrema(h2(extrema) > 0)

    Chapter 4.
        - `remez` not implemented
        - `cf` not implemented
        - `lebesgue` not implemented
        - `chebpade` not implemented

    Chapter 5.
        - `join` will become `chebjoin`
        - `log` not implemented for some reason
        - This chapter is currently broken because of impulses.

    Chapter 6.
        - `spy` not implemented


Umm
----
x = chebfun('x');
h = chebfun({-x, 2*x}, [-1 0 1]);
